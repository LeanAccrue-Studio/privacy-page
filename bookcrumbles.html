    <h1>Privacy Policy – BookCrumbles</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 6, 2026</p>

    <p>
      BookCrumbles ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
      use, and protect information when you use the BookCrumbles mobile application and related services
      (the “Service”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect only the information necessary to provide core functionality of the Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information</strong>, such as your email address and a user identifier,
        provided through Firebase Authentication (including email/password and Google Sign-In).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User-generated content</strong>, including bookshelves, books, notes, tags,
        and timestamps that you create within the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Synchronization data</strong> stored securely in Firebase Firestore to allow your content
        to sync across devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use your information solely to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate your account and manage sign-in.</li>
      <li>Store and synchronize your books and notes.</li>
      <li>Provide and maintain core app features such as editing, search, and export.</li>
      <li>Ensure security, stability, and proper functioning of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.
      Your data is processed only by Google Firebase services acting as data processors
      for authentication and cloud data storage.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      BookCrumbles uses Google Firebase (Authentication and Firestore). These services are governed
      by Google’s own privacy and security policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard security measures. Data is encrypted in transit and protected
      by Firebase security rules and authentication controls. While no system is completely secure,
      we take reasonable steps to protect your information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide
      the Service. Data may be retained longer only if required by law or for legitimate security purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time.
      Upon deletion, your stored content will be permanently removed within a reasonable period,
      unless retention is required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      BookCrumbles is not intended for children under the age of 13.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
    
    <p>
        You can delete your BookCrumbles account and all associated data at any time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In-app deletion</h3>
