<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: January 2026</p>

<p>
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our app
(<strong>the “App”</strong>) handles information and data when you use it.
</p>

The App is designed with privacy in mind. It operates primarily
<strong>offline</strong> and does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit
personal data</strong> to our servers.

</p>

<ul>
  <li>No account registration is required</li>
  <li>No names, email addresses, or phone numbers are collected</li>
  <li>No analytics or tracking identifiers are used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Images and Text Processing</h2>
<p>
All image scanning, OCR (text recognition), and translation features are
performed <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos you take or select are processed only on your device</li>
  <li>Extracted text remains on your device</li>
  <li>No images or text are uploaded to external servers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internet Access</h2>
<p>
The App may optionally use internet access only when you explicitly enable
online features (such as downloading language models or updates).
</p>

<p>
We do not transmit your personal content (images or text) during these
operations.
</p>

Any data generated by the App (such as scanned text or saved images) is stored
locally on your device and can be deleted by you at any time.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under
the age of 13. Since no personal data is collected, the App is safe to use for
all ages.

You are always in control of your data:
